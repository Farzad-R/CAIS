# AT-Conv-LSTM

The repository is originated from the following paper:

H. Zheng, F. Lin, X. Feng and Y. Chen. A Hybrid Deep Learning Model with Attention based Conv-LSTM Networks for Short-Term Traffic Flow Prediction. IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, Preprint, 2020.

With the following Github repo:

I just updated the code so it can work with:
- tensorflow                2.6.0 
- keras                     2.6.0
- numpy                     1.23.5

Run:
- open terminal in the parent folder
- Activate your virtual env
- Run: python Train.py
