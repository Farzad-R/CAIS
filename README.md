# Carleton AI Society (CAIS)
![CAIS](logo/CAIS.png)

This is a collection of AI projects presented at Carleton AI Society ([CAIS](https://carletonai.com/)) workshops. The repository includes code for 
various applications of deep learning, such as text generation with GPT-2, sentiment analysis with BERT, and generating fake images with GAN. 
Each project is accompanied by a detailed description and a link to the source code. Whether you're an AI enthusiast or a beginner looking to 
learn more about deep learning, this repository provides a range of interesting and informative projects to explore.


## cloning the repository:
Open the terminal and enter the directory in which you would like to create the repository and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/Farzad-R/CAIS.git
```

### Project description:
<p>
    <b>- ChatBot:</b> Useing DialoGPT_medium and DialoGPT_large to make chatbots. The code also applies some filters to the 
    responses that the models will genereate. (Please note that the conversations generated by this code are not intended to make sense, 
    as this demonstration serves purely as an illustrative example.)
</p>

<p>
    <b>- GPT2 Text Generation:</b> Using GPT-2 to generate text based on an open-source dataset of movie summaries.
</p>

<p>
    <b>- distributed-training:</b> Distributing tensorflow and pytorch models over a single/multiple
    available GPUs.
</p>
<p>
    <b>- BERT-sentiment-analysis:</b> Performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of movie reviews
    using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) language model.
</p>
<p>
    <b>- GAN-fashion_mnist:</b> Training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the Fashion-MNIST
    dataset to generate fake images.

</p>
<p>
    <b>- OpenCV-real-time-face-detection:</b> Using the Haar Cascade face detection algorithm to detect
    faces in each frame of the video stream from the webcam.

</p>
<p>
    <b>- attention-mechanism:</b> Developing a custom layer for attention mechanism using Keras and seeing
    an example of attention mechanism in traffic forecasting.

</p>
<p>
    <b>- image-classification:</b> Performing image classification on two datasets (cifar10 and mnist)
    using Convolutional Neural Network.

</p>
<p>
    <b>- predict-the-next-word:</b> Training a language model based on LSTM architecture to generate text
    data, specifically movie dialogue.
