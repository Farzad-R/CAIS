![CAIS](logo/CAIS.png)

This is a collection of AI projects presented at Carleton AI Society ([CAIS](https://carletonai.com/)) workshops. The repository includes code for 
various applications of deep learning, such as text generation with GPT-2, sentiment analysis with BERT, and generating fake images with GAN. 
Each project is accompanied by a detailed description and a link to the necessary sources. Whether you're an AI enthusiast or a beginner looking to 
learn more about deep learning, this repository provides a range of interesting and informative projects to explore.


## cloning the repository:
Open the terminal and enter the directory in which you would like to create the repository and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/Farzad-R/CAIS.git
```

### Project description:
<p>
    - <a style=" white-space:nowrap; " href="https://github.com/Farzad-R/CAIS/tree/main/ChatBot"><b>ChatBot</b></a>:
    Useing DialoGPT_medium and DialoGPT_large to make chatbots. The code also applies some filters to the 
    responses that the models will genereate. (Please note that the conversations generated by this code are not intended to make sense, 
    as this demonstration serves purely as an illustrative example.)
</p>

<p>
    - <a style=" white-space:nowrap; " href="https://github.com/Farzad-R/CAIS/tree/main/GPT2-TextGeneration"><b>GPT2-TextGeneration</b></a>:
    Using GPT-2 to generate text based on an open-source dataset of movie summaries.
</p>

<p>
    - <a style=" white-space:nowrap; " href="https://github.com/Farzad-R/CAIS/tree/main/distributed-training"><b>distributed-training</b></a>:

    an example of attention mechanism in traffic forecasting.

</p>
<p>
    <b>- image-classification:</b> Performing image classification on two datasets (cifar10 and mnist)
    using Convolutional Neural Network.

</p>
<p>
    <b>- predict-the-next-word:</b> Training a language model based on LSTM architecture to generate text
    data, specifically movie dialogue.
