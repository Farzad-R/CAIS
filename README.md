### Project description:
<p>
    <b>- distributed-training:</b> Distributing tensorflow and pytorch models over a single/multiple
    available GPUs.
</p>
<p>
    <b>- BERT-sentiment-analysis:</b> Performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of movie reviews
    using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) language model.
</p>
<p>
    <b>- GAN-fashion_mnist:</b> Training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the Fashion-MNIST
    dataset to generate fake images.

</p>
<p>
    <b>- OpenCV-real-time-face-detection:</b> Using the Haar Cascade face detection algorithm to detect
    faces in each frame of the video stream from the webcam.

</p>
<p>
    <b>- attention-mechanism:</b> Developing a custom layer for attention mechanism using Keras and seeing
    an example of attention mechanism in traffic forecasting.

</p>
<p>
    <b>- image-classification:</b> Performing image classification on two datasets (cifar10 and mnist)
    using Convolutional Neural Network.

</p>
<p>
    <b>- predict-the-next-word:</b> Training a language model based on LSTM architecture to generate text
    data, specifically movie dialogue.
